Hello Rodrigo, today (20-02-19) our work has consisted on starting the user interface class, the manager 
and the pojos. We wrote all the system.out and bufferReaders in order to ask the questions to fill the 
tables that we've created. We created 4 Pojo classes: Patient, Doctor, Nurse and device. 
Also, we created the SQLManager class with the methods connect, disconnect, createTables and insert 
(of each polo class).

Hello Rodrigo, this week we created the tables, inserted and selected one entity in a main method.
Before next class, we intend to have all the pojos and the insert and  select method of each one.
