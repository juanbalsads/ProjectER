Our project consists of a database which is designed for the correct functioning of an emergency room. It’s structured in an easy and intuitive way, so that everybody is able to use it without any previous knowledge; but without missing any kind of information.

Firstly, when you initiate the database, you will need to access as a User. there are different user that will enable you to do different tasks: doctor, nurse, er-assistant and database manager. Once you chose one of this option another menu will come up. 

If you enter as a doctor or nurse you will be able to see all the admissions, only your admission, change your availability and see your own data. 
It you enter as the Database Manager you will be in charge of managing the information as you will be able to create, update and delete new doctors, nurse, box, and drugs.
The ER-Assistant is the person in charge of creating the admission and crating the patient as he plays the role of collecting the data of the patient.
