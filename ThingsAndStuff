///in JPAManager when creating how should i look for another class(CREteadmission---Patient)

///When creating all the pojos in JPAManager the id creates automatically so I shoudns ask it by console, but when calling
the constructor to create the instance what should I put in id?In doctors it doesnt set automatically.

///IN my opinion I think that booleans like availability for doctors and nurses should be take out
as we have set that they can have many admission. It doesnt make sense to put an available attribute
as no matter if the are available couse the are going to take another admission

///In other availabilities such as box availabilty it should when creating it should be by default 
available, and we should create a method to change it(Ive already done it in create methods, explain)
